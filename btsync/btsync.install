  User-specific BTSync configuration
 
  Helps to set ownership to someone other than root for files that are copied
  with btsync. Copy /etc/btsync/btsync.conf to ~/.config/btsync/btsync.conf for
  the user you wish to configure btsync as:
 
  mkdir -p ~/.config/btsync
  cp /etc/btsync/btsync.conf ~/.config/btsync/btsync.conf
 
  Replace user-specific references with the appropriate information, including
  the following settings:
 
  - storage_path:
  - pid_file
  - webui.listen
  - webui.login
  - webui.password
 
  To start btsync, execute:
 
  systemctl start btsync@user
 
  where 'user' is your username.
